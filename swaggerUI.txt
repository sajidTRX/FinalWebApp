What should you see at http://localhost:8000/docs#/
The FastAPI Swagger UI should load.
You should see a list of all your API endpoints, grouped by tags or path.
You should be able to expand each endpoint, see the request/response schema, and try out the endpoints directly from the browser.
How to verify everything is okay
Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:8000/docs#/
Check for:
The page loads without errors.
The title is "FastAPI - Swagger UI".
All your endpoints (e.g., /api/files, /api/file/{filename}, /api/drafts, /api/ai/assist, etc.) are listed.
You can expand endpoints and see their details.
Try out an endpoint:
For example, try the GET / or GET /api/files endpoint.
Click "Try it out", then "Execute".
You should get a valid response (e.g., a JSON object).
If you see any issues
If the page does not load, make sure your server is running (uvicorn main:app --reload).
If you see errors in the Swagger UI, check your FastAPI logs for import or runtime errors.
If endpoints are missing, make sure they are defined in your main.py and there are no import errors.
If you describe or screenshot what you see, I can help you diagnose any issues!
If everything loads and endpoints work, then your FastAPI backend is set up correctly.
