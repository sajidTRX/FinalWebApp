This is not a story of heroes and villains, but of a house tearing itself apart. It is a history, a song of sorrow, recorded in the blood of a dynasty at the very zenith of its power. The story begins not with a war, but with a king’s desperate love.

King Viserys I Targaryen ruled the Seven Kingdoms in a time of peace and prosperity. His House, the dragonlords of Valyria, were unchallenged, their great beasts the ultimate symbol of their power. But Viserys had a problem: no son. His beloved wife, Queen Aemma, had suffered many miscarriages and the death of their infant son, Baelon. Desperate for an heir, Viserys, guided by the Grand Maester, chose a horrific path, ordering a brutal C-section to save the child. The boy died, and so did the queen.

Left with only a daughter, the headstrong and capable Rhaenyra, Viserys made a decision that would echo through history. Defying a century of tradition and the whispers of his council, he named Rhaenyra, his firstborn child, as his heir. Hundreds of lords swore fealty to her, vowing to protect her claim.

But a wound had been opened. The king’s grief made him lonely, and his Hand, Otto Hightower, saw an opportunity. He pushed his own daughter, Alicent, the king’s young friend, into Viserys’s orbit. Soon, Alicent became the new queen. The friendship between her and Rhaenyra, once as close as sisters, curdled into a rivalry, poisoned by the difference in their stations.

The true schism began when Alicent gave Viserys what he had always wanted: a son, Aegon, followed by another, Aemond, and a daughter, Helaena. Now, the realm had two competing lines of succession. The court began to split. Those who supported the king’s declared heir, Princess Rhaenyra, were known as "the Blacks," for the color of her house’s sigil. Those who believed the crown should pass to the firstborn son, Prince Aegon, were "the Greens," for the color Queen Alicent often wore.

For years, this was a cold war, fought with whispers and schemes in the halls of power. Rhaenyra, to secure her line, married Laenor Velaryon, though her heart belonged to her roguish uncle, Prince Daemon Targaryen. Her three sons, however, bore a striking resemblance to Harwin Strong, the commander of the City Watch, a fact that everyone noted but no one dared speak aloud. This "illegitimacy" became the Greens’ most potent weapon.
