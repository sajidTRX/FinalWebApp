It begins with a boy who lived. Harry Potter was, for the first eleven years of his life, a nobody. An orphan, he was raised by his cruel aunt and uncle in the cupboard under the stairs, told his parents had died in a car crash. But the truth was a whisper of a name, a shadow of a war that had defined his life before he even knew it. His parents, James and Lily, had been wizards, and they had been murdered by the most feared dark wizard of all time, Lord Voldemort. But when Voldemort had turned his wand on the baby Harry, the killing curse had rebounded, shattering the Dark Lord’s power and leaving Harry with nothing but a lightning-bolt scar.

On his eleventh birthday, the truth came for him. A giant of a man named Hagrid burst through the door, telling Harry he was a wizard, and that he had been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Stepping through the magical barrier at Platform 9¾, Harry entered a world he had only ever dreamed of, a world of moving photographs, owls that delivered post, and a destiny he never asked for.

At Hogwarts, for the first time, he found a home. He was sorted into Gryffindor house and forged two unbreakable bonds: with Ron Weasley, a good-hearted boy from a large, loving, and poor wizarding family, and with Hermione Granger, a brilliant Muggle-born witch who was the cleverest witch of her age. Together, the three became an inseparable trio. He also found a mentor in the wise and enigmatic Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, and an instant rival in the pale, sneering Draco Malfoy, who represented the pure-blood prejudice that had fueled Voldemort’s rise.

But Hogwarts was not entirely safe. In his first year, Harry discovered the three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor and, with his friends, faced a series of trials to stop Voldemort himself, who was clinging to life on the back of his own Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, from stealing the Philosopher’s Stone and regaining a body.

The years that followed deepened the mystery. In his second year, Harry uncovered the Chamber of Secrets, fought a monstrous basilisk, and learned of his strange connection to Voldemort, speaking the serpent’s language and destroying a diary that was, unknown to him, the first of Voldemort’s Horcruxes—fragments of his soul hidden in objects to grant him immortality. In his third year, he confronted the Dementors, spectral guards of the wizard prison that fed on happiness, and learned to conjure a Patronus, a guardian of pure hope. He also discovered the truth about Sirius Black, the man believed to have betrayed his parents, and found in him the godfather and father figure he had always craved.

The turning point came in his fourth year. Hogwarts hosted the Triwizard Tournament, a dangerous competition between schools. Harry, too young to enter, was mysteriously chosen as a champion. The tournament was a trap, designed to lure him to a graveyard where he witnessed the full, terrifying return of Lord Voldemort, now in a body of his own. Harry escaped, but not before watching Voldemort murder his fellow champion, Cedric Diggory. He returned to a world that refused to believe him, left to carry the burden of his story alone.
