A Witcher Tale of the Wild Hunt

The wind howled through the skeletal trees of White Orchard like a grieving spirit. Snow fell in slow, heavy veils, muffling the world beneath a shroud of white. Geralt of Rivia stood at the edge of the frozen river, his breath curling in the air like smoke from a dying fire. His silver medallion — the wolf’s head — trembled against his chest. Not from the cold. From them.

They were coming again.

The Wild Hunt.

He’d seen their spectral riders in dreams — armored wraiths on steeds of shadow and frost, their eyes hollow voids, their horns echoing across the veil between worlds. They called themselves the Sluagh — the Host of the Dead — but Geralt knew their true name: Aen Elle. Elves from another realm, led by the dread king Eredin Bréacc Glas. And they wanted one thing: Ciri.

His daughter. His Child of the Elder Blood.

Geralt clenched his jaw. He hadn’t seen Ciri in months — not since she vanished after the massacre at Kaer Morhen. But her trail was fresh. A burned village. A trail of frost where no frost should be. And whispers… always whispers.

"The girl with ashen hair and eyes like storms… she passed this way." 

He’d followed her from Velen to Novigrad, from the swamps of Crookback Bog to the icy wastes of Skellige. Each step dogged by nightmares. Each night haunted by the Hunt’s horn — that bone-chilling blast that froze blood and shattered sanity.

Now, in this godsforsaken hamlet, he found her mark: a single silver earring, half-buried in snow. Hers. Left deliberately? Or dropped in flight?

A raven cawed overhead. Geralt’s hand drifted to the hilt of his steel sword. Then he froze.

Behind him — silence. Not the quiet of winter. The absence of sound. No wind. No birds. No heartbeat.

He turned.

At the tree line, shadows coalesced. Horses with eyes like dying stars. Riders clad in black ice, their armor forged from sorrow and starlight. At their head, Eredin — tall, cruel, his face a mask of ancient wrath.

"Witcher," the elf king’s voice echoed, not in air, but in Geralt’s mind. "You cannot hide her forever. The Blood calls to us. The World will burn unless she returns to us."

Geralt drew his sword. The blade gleamed blue in the twilight. "She’s not yours to take."

"She is the key to our salvation. And your doom."

The Hunt advanced. Hooves made no sound on snow. The air grew colder — so cold Geralt’s tears would’ve frozen before they fell.

But then — a flicker. A ripple in the air behind the riders.

A figure stepped from the blizzard.

Short. Lean. Ashen hair whipping in the wind. Eyes blazing with green fire.

Ciri.

She raised a hand. The ground trembled. Snow erupted into a wall of ice. The lead rider’s horse reared, screaming.

"Geralt!" she shouted, voice fierce and young and unbearably brave. "I’m not running anymore!"

The Wild Hunt charged.

Geralt ran toward her.

Steel met spectral blade. Magic clashed with ancient power. Ciri tore a rift in reality — a swirling vortex of violet light — and for a heartbeat, Geralt saw other worlds: burning cities, drowned forests, skies filled with twin suns.

Eredin lunged for her.

But Geralt was faster.

His silver sword found the elf king’s throat — not to kill, but to delay. A wound that burned with dimeritium.

The Hunt faltered.

Ciri seized the moment. She screamed — not in fear, but in command — and the rift widened. With a final, deafening roar, the Wild Hunt was sucked into the void, Eredin’s eyes locking with Geralt’s in pure, icy hatred… before vanishing.

Silence returned.

Snow fell again.

Ciri collapsed to her knees, exhausted. Geralt caught her before she hit the ground.

"You came," she whispered.

"Always," he said.

They sat there, father and daughter, as the storm passed. Somewhere, far away, a horn sounded — faint, fading. The Hunt would return. They always did.

But for now, there was fire to build. A warm inn to find. And stories to tell before the next shadow fell.

Because in this broken world, love was the only magic stronger than death.

And so the Witcher rode on — not toward peace, but toward the next storm. With his daughter at his side, and the howl of the Wild Hunt forever at his back.
