                            TIPS
================================================================================

1. Most shortcuts use Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) as a modifier key.

2. Shortcuts are automatically disabled when you're typing in text fields,
   input boxes, or the editor to prevent accidental actions.

3. The Save shortcut (Ctrl+S) always works, even when typing, so you can
   quickly save your work without leaving the editor.

4. Use the arrow keys for navigation in lists and grids. This provides
   a fast way to browse through your documents and entries.

5. The Escape key can be used to close dialogs and modals in some contexts.

6. If a shortcut doesn't work, make sure you're not typing in an input field
   or text editor (except for Ctrl+S which always works).
